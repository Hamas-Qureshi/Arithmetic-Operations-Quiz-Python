 Personal Projects created via Python.
 
 FIRST PROJECT : Arithmetic Equations Quiz
 This software allows the student to select the arithmetic operation she or he wishes to study. 
 The student chooses from a menu one of two arithmetic operations: Addition and Multiplication.
 Based on the student choice, the software tests the user with exactly 10 questions.
 For each question, two random positive one-digit integers are generated; 
 then the student is asked to enter the answer for the arithmetic operations applied to two numbers.
 
 The software displays the number of correct answers and the message “Congratulations!” 
 if more than 6 questions are answered correctly, otherwise, the program will display "Please ask your teacher for help".
 
 This Python function executes the arithmetic test for a student for multiplication or addition operations.
 The function receives as parameter an integer that represents the required operation (1 for multiplication and 0 for addition). 
 Then it gets the student to answer 10 questions as follows:
 
a. Randomly generates two positive one-digit integers.
b. Ask the student to enter the answer for the arithmetic operation of the two
numbers,
c. Checks if the result is correct. If the answer is incorrect, it provides the correct
answer.



SECOND PROJECT: Arithmetic Operation Quiz with Boolean values (Equivalent to the program above, but with boolean function)
The user is tested with 10 questions that are randomly distributed between multiplication and addition. It will also provide the correct answer for the questions that were answered incorrectly.
 
The function to receive an integer representing the required operation (1 for multiplication or 0 for addition), then generate two random numbers, and returns true if the user has answered the question correctly and false if not.
